abstract: Noise pollution has attracted a wide attention due to its negative effect on human health, and many researchers are working on proposing strategies or developing new materials to improve acoustic performance of structures and building materials. Meanwhile, the worldwide emphasis on sustainable development has motivated the development and application of bio-mass materials in every field, including the engineering construction. The purpose of this study is to measure and investigate the performance of a structure-used glued laminated bamboo (Glubam) and spruce-pinefir (SPF) as soundproof or sound-absorbing materials. The impedance tube method was used to measure the sound reduction index and sound absorption coefficient of glubam and SPF in th lab. After doing some comparison studies, it can be found that glubam and SPF have good performance in sound insulation but behave weakly in sound absorption, and glubam exhibits similar even better aoustic properties than SPF. Moreover, a finite element model was built up using ABAQUS to predict sound insulation properties of materials. According to the numercial results of sound reduction index obtained from the finite element model, developing composite materials and double-layer panles with cavity between should be effective on improving the soundproof performance of SPF and glubam.
