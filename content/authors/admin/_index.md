Hello everyone, I am Lejun Zhou, a senior student in Civil Engineering. I am jointly trained by Zhejiang University (ZJU) and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). My research intersets are dynamic network modeling and optimization, autonoumous vehicle system, and optimal transportation. I am optimistic about the future of intelligent transportation and logistics, and hope that my optimization work will advance the development. In the next few years, I will continue to explore more about traffic engineering and operation research in graduate programs, welcome to discuss with me.
